## Agile Mthodology

The project is developed via agile method. Different user stories have been created and implemented on the project. The story details can be found 
[here](https://github.com/users/farhatamannaislam/projects/7/views/1)

The user stories are given below:

* As a user I can view a navbar from every page so that I can navigate easily between pages.
* As a user I can create a new account so that I can access all the features of signed up user.
* As a logged in user I can create post so that I can share it with everyone else on the platform.
* As a user I can view the details of a post so that I know more about it.
* As a user I can view all the recent posts so that I get up to date with the new contents.
* As a user I can search post with keywords so that I can find posts where I am interested.
* As a user I can keep scrolling through the posts so that I don't have to click on next page.
* As a user I can edit my own posts so that I can make corrections/update.
* As a user I can can read comments by other users under posts so that I can know their opinions.
* As a user I can see a list of most followed profiles so that I know which profiles are popular.
* As a user I can follow/unfollow other users so that I can see/un see posts from users which I want to.
* As a user I can get notified when I get like, comment, follow so that I get updated fast with my current scenario.

## Design Choices

* Color: Designer Hub is a provides a vibrant and approachable environment for users. I used vibrant pink logo with a baby pink nav bar color.
The main body is white so that posts are have more highlights. Buttons are bright purple with white text.
