# Project

## User Goal

Users use this platform to express their creativity. They can always update their own ideas and get in touch with the ideas generated by others. 
User can have a great community based interaction with the people from same background. New contents and events are always visible on the top. By liking or commenting they can express their opinios. Designers will get to know what their fellow mates think about their designs. They can follow each other to get in touch with each other. This is a supportive environment. User will fell encouraged to post new designs.

# Project Development

## Wireframes

The wireframes have been created for both mobile and desktop view by [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The major wireframes are drawn. Add post page and add event pages are very similar. Also home page and events Page are similar. So Add Post and Home Page wireframes are drawn.

## Agile Mthodology

The project is developed via agile method. Different user stories have been created and implemented on the project. The story details can be found 
[here](https://github.com/users/farhatamannaislam/projects/7/views/1)

The user stories are given below:

* As a user I can view a navbar from every page so that I can navigate easily between pages.
* As a user I can create a new account so that I can access all the features of signed up user.
* As a logged in user I can create post so that I can share it with everyone else on the platform.
* As a user I can view the details of a post so that I know more about it.
* As a user I can view all the recent posts so that I get up to date with the new contents.
* As a user I can search post with keywords so that I can find posts where I am interested.
* As a user I can keep scrolling through the posts so that I don't have to click on next page.
* As a user I can edit my own posts so that I can make corrections/update.
* As a user I can can read comments by other users under posts so that I can know their opinions.
* As a user I can see a list of most followed profiles so that I know which profiles are popular.
* As a user I can follow/unfollow other users so that I can see/un see posts from users which I want to.
* As a user I can get notified when I get like, comment, follow so that I get updated fast with my current scenario.
* As a user I can see or post events so that I know and update about upcoming incidents.

## Design Choices

* Color: Designer Hub is a provides a vibrant and approachable environment for users. I used vibrant pink logo with a baby pink nav bar color.
The main body is white so that posts are have more highlights. Buttons are bright purple with white text.

* Imagery: All the images used in this website are taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/free%20images/) . The logo is made from

* Balsamiq - to create wireframes.
* Am I responsive? - to check website responsiveness.
* Lighthouse - for site performance.
* Colormind - for generating color palette

# Testing

All the test related Information are found on [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)

# Deployment

* In heroku we have to crate a new app.
* We need to go to 'Deploy' Tab, choose GitHub as 'deployment method' and the find the repository.
* After connecting the repo we have to click 'Deploy Branch'
* Heroku will build the application then. When the build is finished we can see the app by clicking 'Open App'

# Connect React Frontend and API backend

* When we set up the workspace and a basic deploy to Heroku is done, we canc onnect react workspace to our AI.
* In the Heroku dashboard wehave to go to the API application settings
* In 'Settings' we have to add a new Config Var called 'CLIENT_ORIGIN'. The value would be the URL for our deployed React application.
* Then we need to add another Config Var called 'CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV' and its value would be URL of our Gitpod preview link.
* In front end workspace we need to install Axios.
* We need to create a directory named 'API' and inside it a file called 'axiosDefaults'.
* We need to import axios at the top of the file.
* We have to define our base URL which is the URL of our deployed API project.
* We have to set the content-type header to multi-part/form-data as the API will need to deal with images as well as text in it's requests.
* In order to avoid any CORS issues, we need to set withCredentials to True.
* Finally we need to import this file into App.js to be used across all pages.

# Fork the Repository

It is possible to make an independent copy of a GitHub Repository by forking the GitHub account. The copy can then be viewed and edited without affecting the original repository. To fork the repository the steps are given:

After logging in to GitHub, we need to locate the repository. On the top right side of the page there is a 'Fork' button. We need to click on the button to create a copy of the original repository.

# Clone the Repository

In order to create a clone, we need to click on the 'Code' button inside the selected repository and then select the 'Clone' option from the dropdown list. This clone copy will continue to synchronize with the original repository.
